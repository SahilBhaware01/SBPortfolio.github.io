# Sahil Bhaware – Data Engineering  Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website!  
I'm a Data Software Engineer with 2 years of experience in building scalable ETL pipelines using Python, SQL, and Big Data technologies on AWS and GCP. With a strong foundation in Computer Engineering and Business Administration, I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence.

I specialize in data engineering, where I design and optimize robust, modular data workflows that empower organizations to make data-driven decisions. I’m proficient in core data structures and algorithms, and I bring strong problem-solving and system design skills to every project. I follow best practices in software development, including Git version control, CI/CD pipelines, code reviews, and Agile methodologies.

Passionate about performance tuning, continuous learning, and cross-functional collaboration, I thrive on delivering high-impact data solutions that bridge business needs with technical execution.

## 📈 Projects

### 🔐 Steganography using Generative Adversarial Networks  
Developed and trained GAN models using TensorFlow on preprocessed CelebA data for image steganography, achieving over 85% message decoding accuracy with less than 5% visual distortion (SSIM).  
*Tools:* TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Python, AES (PyCryptodome), CelebA Dataset, SSIM (scikit-image)

### 🧹 Integration Crime Database  
Designed a unified crime database by integrating NY and Chicago datasets via schema mapping, and fine-tuned a BERT-based NLP model to reduce missing data by 40% through accurate law code and location imputation.  
*Tools:* Python, Pandas, NumPy, BERT (Hugging Face Transformers), TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, SQL, Data Modeling Techniques

### 📊 Analysis of Modern Optimization Techniques using Gradient Centralization  
Applied Batch and Weight Normalization on the CIFAR-100 dataset to stabilize and accelerate learning, and used Gradient Centralization with various optimizers, identifying RMSProp as the top performer based on training time, accuracy, loss, and F1-score.  
*Tools:* TensorFlow, Keras, Python, CIFAR-100 Dataset (tensorflow.keras.datasets), Scikit-learn (metrics), Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy
